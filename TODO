- Implement .remove
   - Possible to make it safe inside opApply? (Probably not.)
- IMPORTANT: .get, .opIndex, and .opBinaryRight!"in" need to accept key types
  that implicit convert to Key, not just Key itself.
   - Also, .opIndexAssign needs to be clever enough to NOT copy the input key
     unless it needs to create a new entry.
